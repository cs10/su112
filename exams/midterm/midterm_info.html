<h4>Material Coverage</h4>
The midterm will test material covered since the beginning of the semester until week 4 (inclusive)
-- everything we have done in class (readings, lectures, labs,
homeworks) up through, but not including, the HCI lecture, except what was covered in discussion.

<h4>Administration</h4>
The midterm will be at <strong>6-8PM, July 23rd at 2060 VLSB</strong>.
The midterm will be administered in <em>two parts</em>.
The first part will be administered at
<a href="http://berkeley.edu/map/maps/AB45.html"
style="text-decoration: none;"><strong>200 Sutardja Dai</strong></a> in your first lab of the week.
It will be administered during the <strong>second hour of the lab section that you regularly attend</strong>.
For example, if you attend the 1pm to 3pm section, for the first hour, 1-2, there will be a survey and then
a review. Then the first part of your midterm will be administered from 2pm to
3pm.  The first part of the midterm will be done on the computer: you will each sit one computer
per student, and we will ask you to download files and instructions off of a certain location.
You will submit your final answers on <a href="http://bspace.berkeley.edu"
style="text-decoration: none;">bSpace</a>.

<br/><br/>

The second part will be administered at <a href="http://berkeley.edu/map/maps/BC45.html"
style="text-decoration: none;"><strong>2060 VLSB</strong></a> from <strong>6pm to 8pm</strong>.
It will be done on paper, and we will provide a list of the blocks available in Scratch and BYOB
that you can use.  The style of this part of the midterm will be similar to that of the Quest:
we will ask you questions on the readings, on various concepts, and on programming in BYOB.
You are allowed <strong>two study sheets</strong> of size 8.5" x 11", handwritten on both
sides.

<br/><br/>

Please let the staff know if you have a legitimate conflict with the times of the midterm
administrations so that we can make alternate arrangements.  Please let us know <em>as soon
as possible</em>; we cannot help you if you inform us the day before the midterm.

<h4>Review Session</h4>
There will be a review session for the midterm, from <strong>1pm to 4pm</strong> on
<strong>Sunday 7-22</strong>, at <a href="http://berkeley.edu/map/maps/AB45.html"
style="text-decoration: none;"><strong>306 Soda</strong></a>.  The presentation
from the review session is available <a href="http://bit.ly/a3YV0Q"
style="text-decoration: none;">here</a>.

<h4>Preparation</h4>
First off, don't panic!  Drink some chamomile tea, take a deep breath, and maybe even
<a href="http://xkcd.com/135/" style="text-decoration: none;">read this
comic strip</a>.  Work through the labs and homeworks once again, and ask questions if anything
is unclear.  We have also posted previous Midterms below. You may find them useful to get a sense
